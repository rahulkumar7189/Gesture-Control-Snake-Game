<p id="description">Gesture-Controlled Nokia Snake Game Play the classic Nokia Snake game using nothing but your hand gestures! This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking to control the snake all wrapped in a nostalgic Nokia-green theme. Control the snake's direction with swipe gestures pinch your fingers for a speed boost and restart the game with a hand gesture! 📸 Demo (This is the most important part of your README! Record a short GIF or video of the game in action and replace the placeholder below.) Two windows will open: the Pygame game window and the OpenCV window showing your hand tracking. ✨ Features Gesture-Based Control: Control the snake's direction (Up Down Left Right) using real-time hand swipe gestures. Speed Boost: Pinch your thumb and index finger together to activate a temporary speed boost. Gesture-Based Restart: Simply show an 'UP' gesture after a "Game Over" to restart the game. Nostalgic Graphics: Classic Nokia-style monochrome green graphics complete with blocky snake segments and a 3D-effect head. Visual Feedback: A separate OpenCV window shows your webcam feed with MediaPipe's hand landmarks overlaid so you can see what the computer sees. Particle Effects: A simple particle burst fires when the snake eats a fruit. Multi-Threaded Architecture: The game logic (Pygame) and the gesture detection (OpenCV/MediaPipe) run on separate threads for smooth performance without lag. 🛠️ Tech Stack Python 3.8+ Pygame: For the core game logic rendering and window management. OpenCV: To capture and process the webcam feed. MediaPipe: For real-time hand landmark detection and gesture recognition. NumPy: For high-performance numerical operations (used by MediaPipe and OpenCV). 🚀 Getting Started A setup script is included to make installation easy. 1. Clone the Repository git clone [https://github.com/rahulkumar7189/gesture-control-snake-game.git](https://github.com/rahulkumar7189/gesture-control-snake-game.git) cd gesture-control-snake-game 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended) # For Windows python -m venv venv .\venv\Scripts\activate # For macOS/Linux python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate 3. Run the Setup Script This script will automatically check for and install all required libraries (pygame opencv-python mediapipe numpy). python setup.py 4. Run the Game! Once setup is complete just run main.py: python main.py Make sure your webcam is connected and has permission to be used. 🎮 How to Play (Controls) Move Hand (Swipe): Move your entire hand in the direction you want the snake to go (UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT). Pinch (Speed Boost): Pinch your thumb and index finger together to make the snake move faster. Show 'UP' Gesture: After a Game Over make an 'UP' gesture to restart the game. Quit: Press the ESC key on the Pygame window to close the game. 📁 File Structure . ├── .gitignore ├── LICENSE ├── README.md <- You are here! ├── gesture_controller.py <- Handles webcam MediaPipe detection and gesture logic. ├── main.py <- Main entry point. Manages threads and combines game + gestures. ├── setup.py <- Installation script to set up dependencies. └── snake_game.py <- The Pygame snake game logic and rendering. 🧠 How It Works The application runs in two main threads to ensure high performance: Main Thread (main.py): Runs the pygame game loop. Listens for Pygame events (like ESC key). Receives the latest gesture commands (e.g. Direction.UP is_speed_boost) from the gesture thread. Calls game.update() and game.draw() at a fixed framerate. Gesture Thread (main.py -> gesture_controller.py): Runs a separate loop that continuously captures frames from the webcam using cv2. Processes each frame with mediapipe to find hand landmarks. Calculates swipe gestures based on hand movement and a pinch gesture based on finger distance. Updates a shared GameManager state that the main thread can read. Displays the annotated webcam feed in a separate "Gesture Control" window. This multi-threaded design prevents the computationally-heavy CV/ML model from blocking or lagging the Pygame game loop resulting in a smooth responsive experience. 📄 License This project is licensed under the MIT License.
